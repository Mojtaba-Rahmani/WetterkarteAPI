<h1>WeatherMap<h1/>

<h3> The show of the weather </h3>


<p dir="auto"> The idea is to show purely current weather data on the client side

The “OpenWeatherMap” service was used here because this service is free.


I used the information from this service in my API project.

This information consists of:
- Current temperature
- Minimum temperature
- Maximum temperature
- Air pressure
- Humidity
- Wind speed
- Wind direction
- Cloudiness
